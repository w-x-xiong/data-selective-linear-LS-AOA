# data-selective-linear-LS-AOA

This is the source code of the data-selective linear LS algorithm (Algorithm 1) in our IPIN 2021 conference paper:

W. Xiong et al., "Two Efficient and Easy-to-Use NLOS Mitigation Solutions to Indoor 3-D AOA-Based Localization," 2021 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), 2021, pp. 1-8, doi: 10.1109/IPIN51156.2021.9662529.

You could use the code for your comparisons at will, as long as the paper above is included as a reference in your manuscript.
